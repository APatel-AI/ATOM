<h1> Shape Animation </h1>

<h4>
This is a three.js project designed to experiment with creating interactive shapes using three.js. 
In this particular project I have designed an Atom like animation with revolving rings and have attempted to add molecules in certain areas of the "Atom".
Altogether it is a learning project where one can apply concepts of three.js to better understand the enviroment.
